one includes code 2024-0001 updates. By mid-year, on 2024-06-15, version 1.3.7 will release. 
Tests set for 2024-09-10 aim to finalize fixes in module 4321-567. Full rollout ends by 2024-12, under code ID-2233.""",
    "long-1k": """The lexxai_2024 project is scheduled to undergo extensive updates throughout the year, 
with a focus on key milestones. The primary phases are set between 2024-01-01 and 2024-12-31, 
with initial assessments conducted from 2024-02-15 to 2024-03-10, aligning with quarterly 
objectives. Phase 1 begins with module code 1001-2024 on 2024-01-20, emphasizing feature 
integration and system stability. By mid-2024, specifically on 2024-06-30, version 2.5.6 will 
be deployed, addressing updates outlined in spec doc 5678-2024. Testing iterations, set under 
reference codes 2024-07-05 and 3035-060, will extend until 2024-09-15, focusing on optimization. 
To ensure data integrity, checkpoint verifications will be aligned with identifiers 'ID-7890' 
and 'ID-0123' during the periods 2024-08-01 to 2024-10-31. A comprehensive review is planned 
around 2024-11-05, followed by a final deployment milestone targeted for 2024-12-15. Each 
segment will undergo compliance checks with predefined codes, including 4125-2024 and 9980-2024, 
to meet project standards. The year concludes with a detailed report due on 2024-12-30, 
summarizing progress and noting key adjustments for 2025-Q1 implementation.""",
    "long-2k": """The lexxai_2024 project is a comprehensive initiative that spans the entirety of 2024, focusing on 
staged improvements, testing, and final deployment. The initial kick-off starts on 2024-01-05, where 
core objectives and timelines are established under project code 1001-LEXX. This phase will see the 
groundwork laid out for all subsequent updates, with key system specifications outlined between 
2024-02-01 and 2024-03-31. The first major milestone is set for 2024-04-15, where version 1.0.0 is 
expected to be fully functional. This update will address essential feature sets tagged with identifier 
'ID-2244' and will undergo rigorous testing until 2024-05-20.

By 2024-06-10, phase two begins, marked by the release of version 1.5.3. This version is focused on 
performance optimization and will incorporate enhancements specified in technical documentation 
3456-TECH, with the final feature review completed by 2024-07-01. During this period, quality assurance 
(QA) tests are scheduled under test case identifiers 'TEST-7891' and 'TEST-2345'. Special emphasis will 
be placed on modules 5678-MODULE and 9988-MODULE, targeting code refactoring and latency reduction.

From 2024-08-01 to 2024-09-15, a critical testing phase begins under phase three, where modules with 
codes 2024-UPDATE and 3035-OPT will be evaluated. Each module must meet strict compliance standards 
before 2024-10-05. Updates are prioritized for system stability, and a secondary review of documentation 
7890-SPEC will ensure all criteria are met. A special beta release, version 2.0.0-BETA, is planned for 
2024-09-25, to allow for user feedback and additional stress testing until 2024-10-15.

The final implementation stage, phase four, commences on 2024-10-20, with version 2.1.0 tagged under 
project code 8765-PROD. This release focuses on full integration and incorporates user feedback collected 
during the beta phase. A large-scale test will take place from 2024-11-01 to 2024-11-20 under IDs 
'ID-9901' and 'ID-3456'. The focus during this time will be on load balancing, database performance, and 
ensuring that security protocols (outlined in SEC-2024) are fully operational.

The penultimate step involves a detailed audit, beginning on 2024-11-25, where all project components 
are reviewed under audit codes AUDIT-6543 and AUDIT-4321. Final adjustments, including UI refinements, 
bug fixes, and system security hardening, will be completed by 2024-12-10. The official full deployment 
for version 3.0.0 is scheduled for 2024-12-20, completing the year-long effort.

Post-deployment support is expected to run until 2025-01-31, with continued monitoring based on error 
codes tracked during the first two weeks after launch. The project closure report, with a full summary 
of all key milestones, challenges, and successes, will be drafted by 2025-02-10, under report ID 
'REP-2025-FINAL'. This document will serve as the definitive record for the lexxai_2024 project, 
providing insights and recommendations for the following year's initiatives.""",
