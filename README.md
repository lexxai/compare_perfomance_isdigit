# Optimizing Performance: Python Speed Test for Digit Search in Strings

⛓️ In reply to post: https://lnkd.in/e56KKsMp

🪜 I wanted to check the real speeds of these methods, so I decided to conduct an experiment myself.

I looked at how fast each method performs when searching for digits in short strings, and compared their efficiency in terms of execution time.

After comparing several approaches, I will share my conclusions about which one is the best in terms of actually using Python for this task.
